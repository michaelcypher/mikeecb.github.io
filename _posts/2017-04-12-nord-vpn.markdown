I've been using [NordVPN][nordvpn] full-time now for a couple weeks ([post-FCC privacy rules][fcc]) and wanted to praise one of it's features... the <b>Kill Switch</b>.

NordVPN's Kill Switch feature lets users configure a list of applications to shutdown automatically when you disconnect from the VPN. This theoretically prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data and I have it currently set to kill Chrome, TorBrowser and LimeChat.

<div class="center-media img-container" alt="NordVPN's Kill Switch feature">

    <img src="/assets/imgs/nord-vpn-kill-switch.jpg" class="overlay-img">
</div>
<p class="image-label">NordVPN's Kill Switch feature</p>

NordVPN also claims to have a Strict No Logs Policy and doesn't appear to leak your DNS queries or IP address according to tests I ran using [dnsleaktest][dnsleaktest] and [ipleak][ipleak]. So far, my only concern is that NordVPN "does not support IPv6". This might mean that IPv6 addresses are leaked, I'm not sure. Let's hope they fix this in 2017.

I am generally pretty pleased with NordVPN, but I did purchase a $69 1-year plan (so I would expect to be pleased)! If you decide to purchase a NordVPN subscription based on what I've said, using [this referral link][referral] should give you credits towards your subscription renewal!
