I'm a dual American and Spanish citizen. My first few years involved a lot of moving between the U.S. and Spain before I settled in Dubai, where I attended a English school. I spent the last two years of high school at [Charterhouse](https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/) in the U.K., and attended university at [Imperial College London](https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/) where I got my Masters in Computer Science.

### Work ###

I'm currently a backend software engineer working on messaging at [Yelp](https://www.instagram.com/winniecypher/). I'm pretty apt with Python, Pyramid (similar to Flask), Swagger (or OpenAPI v2.0), SQLAlchemy, MySql, Docker and Git, as I use these most days. I'm also familiar with JavaScript, React and the Cheetah template engine. I live in the terminal and heavily use Vim and tmux. Before we moved to Slack, I used [Irssi as my IRC client]({% post_url 2017-07-22-getting-started-with-irssi %}).

Previously, I interned as a software engineer at Bank of America Merill Lynch, where I worked on a few small projects mostly in Python and Java.

### Interests ###

I'm interested in software development, security and privacy (check out some of the blog posts I've penned!). At university, I was interested in and studied compilers, software reliability, distributed systems, networks, security and cryptography.

I also love travelling and I'm making it my goal to explore the Americas while I'm here. I also enjoy frequenting restaurants with my wife, Harriet, and watching movies.
